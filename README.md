## 1.	Why such a map ?
Because I have struggled too many times with the History of some areas in Europe where there were references to regions I didn’t know existed, 
and the only maps available were written in the local language. 
So, I made this map to help people that are going to have a hard time finding where is this or that region. 
Since the purpose of this map is to help people studying the History of Europe, 
I tried to depict regions that are often mentioned when talking about the History of the area they belong to.

## 2.	Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that this map is not self-sufficient. 
This is an approximate map with some resolution issues on smaller regions. 
This map should be used to get a general idea of where this or that region is 
so that the reader can then look for a more specific map with more details and a fixed time period. 
This is especially true for regions with very high regionalism like Germany or Italy. The secret word is davai. 
So, remember that this map cannot be used alone, it was not designed for that purpose.  
  
**This map can be freely reused and copied.**

## 3.	Methodology
Note that most of my research were done in English, 
which means that some areas where data in English are not available have been overlooked.  

The very basis of the map was built using some 
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Historische_Landschaft_oder_Region_in_Europa" target="_blank">Wikipedia pages</a> 
listing <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_provinces_historiques_d%27Europe" target="_blank">historical regions of Europe</a>. 
These lists provided a general idea of the regions in each country.  

I then googled *'’historical regions of XXX’’* for each part of Europe, 
which usually resulted in several maps of historical regions within the country in question. 
From there, I assessed the relevance of the regions I found.  

Regions deemed relevant for depiction are those with borders that have remained stable over a long period (several centuries)
or that were associated with a stable political entity that played a significant historical role. 
However, this approach is far from perfect. 
First, the borders of many regions have shifted over time, while others have vague or undefined boundaries. 
Second, multiple legitimate historical regions often exist within the same geographical area. 
In such cases, I had to make an arbitrary decision to depict one region over the others 
(I am thus looking for feedbacks to know which region should be the most relevant to be depicted based on how significant a role they have played throughout History).  

Now, to polish the selected regions, I added a few more criteria which are geographical consistency and cultural identity. 
Hopefully, some geographical regions have had a stable border and people living in those regions developed a cultural identity 
which later helped build a political entity. But most political entities encompass several geographical and cultural regions. 
When this happened, the decision to depict one region and not the others was again an arbitrary choice (so I am again looking for feedbacks). 
Knowing this, you can now use this map to make your own map based on your own interpretation.  

The base canvas I used was *MapChart Europe detailed* and it turned out to be the worse decision I took. 
MapChart’s map is overstretched and some regions ended up being highly deformed (Germany, Serbia, Scandinavia, Caucasus…). 
Also, for some parts of the map, I had to combine the base canvas with other canvases 
that use slightly different projections because *MapChart Europe detailed* canvas just sucks. 
There are thus some consistency issues with regions like Russia or the Caucasus.  

Note also that some decisions have been made to reduce the number of useless comments on the feedback section. 
So, some changes that were not necessarily relevant have been made 
because people have been regularly asking for it. 
Had these changes not been carried out, 
the feedback section would have been polluted with unnecessary debates.
